This project is about making\/hacking food and beverages as was the case on last three CCC events (http:\/\/events.ccc.de\/camp\/2011\/wiki\/Food_Hacking_Base camp, http:\/\/events.ccc.de\/congress\/2011\/wiki\/Food_hacking_base 28c3). We need to have place to gather, share our products as tasters promoting what is this about and be able to run workshops (on the spot if possible for smaller events, bigger workshops will be signed separately as workshops). Also it would be good to have this time more place to sit down and just chat. Last two years we had a small spot to ourselves which allowed us to present and keep some staff but we need something bigger during whole event, we have grown. I'm in touch with some ccc folk already included Kamiwolf (food archangel). If possible we should be located close to the ccc kitchen(heaven) because we hope to cooperate with the folk there (I was in charge of the night shift food preparations for angels at 28c3 and I hope to do the same this year). Honestly most of the people will sign in for the smaller scale lectures and workshops again one or two weeks before if not few days before the event and I need to make sure that they will have a decent location to do what they want.
