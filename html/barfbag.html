<h1>BarfBag v1.0</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Known Issues & Workarounds</h2>
<p><strong>UPDATE ISSUE:</strong><br>
BarfBag 1.0 has a small bug, which prevents correct updating of the Fahrplan data in german language. To keep up-to-date, please <u>switch the language of your device to english language</u>, than update the Fahrplan. You can switch it back to german after that procedure, but you need to repeat this as a german speaking user everytime you want an updated schedule (Sorry, this just happens if you are coding into early morning hours... don't do that.).</p>

<p><strong>CERTIFICATE ISSUE:</strong><br>
Opening Wiki Pages in the internal webbrowser of BarfBag may fail due to unverifyable SSL-certs. Please point your Safari to the CAcert-site and download/install the root-certificate from CAcert on your device. Please choose &quot;Class 1 PKI-Schluessel / Stammzertifikat (PEM Format)&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Here is the link:</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3">http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3</a></p>
<p>After the install of the certificate, please <u>restart the complete device by switching it off and on</u> again (Yes, I know this feels like using windows). Restart BarfBag again, now all sites should be shown correctly.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>LIVE STREAMS:</strong><br>
The live streams will be up and running as soon as the congress begins. The app will fetch the correct and up-to-date info when updating its Master Configuration. You can enforce this by <u>pressing the &quot;RESET&quot;-button</u> in the Settings. Your favourites will be kept even if you reset all Settings!</p>

<p><strong>CLOUD SYNC:</strong><br>
When using iCloud sync there might occur an issue where the app on wake from sleep displays a white screen. Please kill the app when this happens. It is a bug. You can avoid this bug by <u>turning off iCloud sync</u> if you do not need it and just switch it on occasionally to sync the stuff you need.</p>

<p><strong>BACKUP SERVER:</strong><br>
In case of problems connecting to the chaos infrastructure you can switch the app to use the backupserver to update its schedule, workshop & assembly informations. Just <u>switch in the Settings to &quot;Use Backupserver permanently&quot;</u> this will fetch the latest publicly available data which was cached by the backupserver. Usually this should be also significantly speedup the refresh of data during autoupdate.</p>

<h2>Help & Service</h2>
<p>During congress developers of BarfBag (i.e. trailblazr & plaetzchen) will be around at the CCH. You can meet them and asking them questions is welcome. It is allowed to buy them a Club Mate or a Hot Coffee. ;-) If you do that, they might provide you with a completely bugfixed release of the app directly to your device.</p>
<p>BarfBag was coded pretty quickly from scratch in just 14 days (okay actually this was 14 nights). Since we had to meet a deadline for Apple to review it, small issues of the app (which are already fixed and mentioned above) are still remaining in release 1.0. The fixes did not make it into the final release on the AppStore until now but there will be an update after the congress. Please be patient with us! We tried our very best. :)</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback for the App is very welcome. You can leave <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?id=583709361&pageNumber=0&sortOrdering=1&type=Purple+Software&mt=8">Feedback on the Appstore (open in Safari, please.)</a> and in the congress wiki's <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Talk:BarfBag">discussion page (you need to be a registered user)</a> or you send an <a href="mailto:trailblazr@noxymo.com?subject=Feedback%20BarfBag">email</a> to the devs of <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/BarfBag">BarfBag</a>.
